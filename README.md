# Puppeteer-Powered High-Performance Video Playback Automation 
 
**Description:**

This Node.js project offers a robust and scalable solution for automating video playback using Puppeteer. It caters to various use cases requiring efficient video processing and playback control. This can be used as youtube view bot. 

**Key Features:**

* **Parallelized Playback:** Efficiently manages multiple headless Chrome instances, enabling concurrent video playback across various URLs for maximized throughput.
* **Enhanced Covertness:** Employs Faker to generate dynamic HTTP headers, masking automation for increased reliability by mimicking legitimate browser behavior.
* **Granular Playback Control:** Provides programmatic control over video playback speed, allowing for tailored processing based on specific requirements.
* **Optional Resource Consumption Optimization:** Integrates the capability to dynamically switch video quality to the lowest resolution available, potentially reducing bandwidth usage.
* **Asynchronous Completion Handling:** Utilizes event listeners and waitForFunction to efficiently monitor video completion within each tab, ensuring smooth processing of video queues.
